## Rules

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

## About The Project

Project is implementation of game functionality on the website. During gameplay the website will interact intuitively

my [JS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). I wrote JS code and modified CSS code for
responsive with given markup.
