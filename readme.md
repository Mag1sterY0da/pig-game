## Rules

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

## About The Project

Project is implementation of game functionality on the website. During gameplay the website will interact intuitively
clearly.
Each visit to the page the new game begins, also you can start a new one with a button. This project was built during
my [JS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). I wrote only JS code; all markup
was already completed.

## Demo
